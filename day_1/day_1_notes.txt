Functional Components

-- these are javascript function they can optionally recieve object of properties which is referred to as props and return HTML describes th UI.
    Html means in here is JSX but right now we going to use html and js files only for a beginner stage
-- for example try to study/understand code to learn.
-- in simple way functions are called by using Components
-- first create a js file inside a component folder which will be inside src folder.
-- import react from  'react' and write you functions ; after that export the file name
-- now import your file component to your app.js file and call the function name inside a html tag

-- now we using arrow syntax for creating a function.
-- Note: inside one function component only one function name will be there. if we want to create more function then we have to create them inside 
    that function component.


Class Components

-- its similar to functional component ,also can optionally props as input and return HTML
-- it can maintain a private internal state it means mainatin private information for component and use that information to describe the user interface to get comparison
-- create a js file and extend a class name with component folder, inside class render html tags after that export the class name and import class in app.js
